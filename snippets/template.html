<p>This product is certified by our supplier, Stanley/Stella as GOTS, Oeko-Tex
    Standard 100, Fair Wear and Vegan Approved. Since we are not a certified
    company yet, unfortunately we can’t market these products as certified
    ourselves. We pay great attention to the materials we choose, to make sure they
    are healthy for you and the Planet, even though we can’t gain any competitive
    advantage through certificates. We just find it the right thing to do and we want
    to be as transparent as we possibly can.</p>
