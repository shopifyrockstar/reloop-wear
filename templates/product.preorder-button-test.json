If sustainably and ethically produced, organic cotton is a great alternative to conventional cotton and it’s likely the most popular choice for an eco-textile. Contrary to conventional cotton, it uses far less water, no insecticides, reduces contamination of groundwater, poses no risk of cancer to workers, and encourages biodiversity. Globally, conventional cotton cultivation accounts for about 5% of global pesticide use even though it is cultivated only on about 2.5% of global arable land. From a circularity perspective, being a natural fiber, it has the added benefits of being 100% biodegradable, given there were no harmful chemicals used during the processing of the fiber. Certain certifications can help with the evaluation. The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), covers the processing, manufacturing, packaging, labelling, trading and distribution of textiles, ensuring that both environmental and social standards, such as safe and hygienic working conditions, no workplace discrimination and fair pay rates, are respected. This isn’t however the only certification focusing on organic cotton. There are also others like Organic Content Standard (OCS), Cotton madein Africa Organic, the EU Organic Standard, bioRe Sustainable Cotton or the Fairtrade Cotton. <\/p><p><strong>Recycled polyester<\/strong><\/p><p>Recycled polyester is a better alternative to a virgin polyester. It is made of recycled plastic bottles or old clothes. Using recycled instead of virgin polyester reduces our dependency on fossil fuels, requires less energy, and produces fewer carbon emissions. By using plastic waste, it is diverted from oceans and landfills. The problem of releasing the microfibers and biodegradability remains the same though, which is why we encourage you to use the microplastic filters in your washing machine like <a href=\"https:\/\/planetcare.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/planetcare.org\/\">here <\/a>or microplastic bags like <a href=\"https:\/\/en.guppyfriend.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/en.guppyfriend.com\/\">here<\/a>. <\/p>"
