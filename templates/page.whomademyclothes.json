        "content": "<p>'Radical Transparency’ has become quite the buzzword in the fashion industry lately. By definition, transparency implies being as honest and open as possible, in this case, regarding how clothes are made. If consumers want to make responsible choices, they need to know what’s going on behind the scenes, what a brand stands for, and how they address important issues. <\/p><p>On April 2013, an eight-story commercial building in Bangladesh collapsed to the ground, killing 1,134 garment workers and injuring an additional 2,500. The tragedy -referred to as the Rana Plaza disaster- motivated the founders of Fashion Revolution to create a movement that would go behind-the-scenes of the fashion industry, shedding light on the manufacturing processes and holding companies accountable for their actions. <\/p><p>In 2014, the #WhoMadeMyClothes hashtag was born, instantly becoming a global trend that is still running strong today. This, however, is just the beginning. Transparency serves as a stepping stone into a better future for all of us.<\/p><p>With <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">greenwashing <\/span>rearing its ugly head, transparency is more important than ever, backing claims with evidence and certification. At the same time, big, pompous claims of ‘radical transparency’ may also smell a bit like greenwashing, right? Let’s make this point really clear: at Reloop Wear, we believe in transparency and we’re fully committed to it. Yet, we believe “radical” postures never brought anything good in the past. Our transparency isn’t radical, it’s just TRUE. <\/p><p>We know we’re not perfect -and we’re not trying to be- but our promise is to be honest. This means publishing all the details and information about our manufacturing processes. We want you to be confident in your purchases and to know all the details behind our products. No secrets, no small print. <\/p><p>Are you wondering who made your clothes? <br\/>Read on.<\/p>",

Their mission is to offer products that respect both people and the environment, creating high quality garments in the most responsible and ethical way.<\/p><p>Stanley\/Stella has been exposed to criticism, raising questions about its ethics due to having its factories in Bangladesh.

Based on the reports, they work with 100% organic cotton sourced from India, recycled polyester from China and other sustainable materials such as Modal from Austria, while ensuring the safety of their workers by collaborating closely with the Fair Wear Foundation (FWF). Apart from this, their team in Dhaka visits every factory to check that workers receive a decent salary and that their rights are fully respected. <\/p><p>After much investigation, we have decided to trust and work with Stanley\/Stella in these first steps of our journey.
