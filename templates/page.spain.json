This magical place is a must visit in Jordan. There are many cool camps that offer an authentic experience through the simple Bedouin life of the valley with its charm and beauty. One of these\ncamps is Sun city camp. You can stay in the Martian domes where you get to lay on your bed atnight watching the stars, or you can choose the traditional authentic Bedouin tent. Either way you will be able to enjoy the serenity and calmness this place has to offer. There are several \nactivities most camps offer there like: hiking and trekking through the big red stones or taking a jeep tour which can be a good way to see a large area of the massive desert biosphere in a short time. You can do yoga exercises at sunrise, watch the sun sets below the infinite \nlandscape horizon or enjoy stargazing at night. Since most of the land is undeveloped, the sky over Wadi Rum is unbelievably dark and full of more stars than you can imagine."
