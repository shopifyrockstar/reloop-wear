If sustainably and ethically produced,organic cotton is a great alternative to conventional cotton and it’s likelythe most popular choice for an eco-textile. Contrary to conventional cotton, ituses far less water, no insecticides, reduces contamination of groundwater,poses no risk of cancer to workers, and encourages biodiversity. Globally,conventional cotton cultivation accounts for about 5% of global pesticide useeven though it is cultivated only on about 2.5% of global arable land. From acircularity perspective, being a natural fiber, it has the added benefits ofbeing 100% biodegradable, given there were no harmful chemicals used during theprocessing of the fiber. Certain certifications can help with the evaluation.The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), covers the processing,manufacturing, packaging, labelling, trading and distribution of textiles,ensuring that both environmental and social standards, such as safe andhygienic working conditions, no workplace discrimination and fair pay rates,are respected. This isn’t however the only certification focusing on organiccotton. There are also others like Organic Content Standard (OCS), Cotton madein Africa Organic, the EU Organic Standard, bioRe Sustainable Cotton or theFairtrade Cotton. <\/p><p><strong>Recycledpolyester<\/strong><\/p><p>Recycled polyester is a better alternative to avirgin polyester. It is made of recycled plastic bottles or old clothes. Usingrecycled instead of virgin polyester reduces our dependency on fossil fuels,requires less energy, and produces fewer carbon emissions. By using plasticwaste, it is diverted from oceans and landfills. The problem of releasing themicrofibers and biodegradability remains the same though, which is why weencourage you to use the microplastic filters in your washing machine like here or microplastic bags like here<\/p>"
