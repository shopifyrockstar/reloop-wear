            "answer": "<p>Terms like sustainability and circularity are often used interchangeably, whereas they are two different things. <\/p><p>Sustainability was defined by the Brundtland Report as \"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs\". <\/p><p>While sustainability is more broadly related to people, the planet and the economy, circularity is focused on resource cycles. It implies closing the loop and cycling raw materials back into the manufacturing process to minimise waste along the supply chain. <\/p><p><strong>How it relates to fashion?<\/strong><\/p><p>In 2017 Anna Brismar developed the idea of circular fashion. She defined it as clothes, shoes or accessories that are designed, sources, produced and provided with the intention to be used, to circulate responsibly and effectively in society, and then returned safely to the biosphere when no longer of use. <\/p><p>In summary, circular fashion implies reusing resources, starting from the initial design stage to the end of the product's lifecycle, and looping materials back to the system over and over again. <\/p><p>Sustainable fashion uses materials produced from natural resources, with minimum environmental impact and carbon footprint. <\/p><p>By being aware of sustainability and circularity and making the right decisions, we can minimize waste along the supply chain and reduce teh environmental impact that comes with fashion production. By being more responsible manufacturers and consumers, we can save teh planet from unnecessary waste and pollution.<\/p>"
