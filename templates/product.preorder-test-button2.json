It is often a result of an overestimation of a brand or an order cancelation. Deadstock fabrics are offered at the lower quantities, thanks to which small brands like ours are able to meet the minimum order quantities and avoid overproduction. It is important to call out the available stock fabrics, which is an overproduced fabric, when a factory knows that it's worth producing more, because it will eventually sell it. This is not what we support and we make sure we choose the responsible suppliers, like Rekotex, to choose the genuine deadstock fabrics for our products. <\/p><p><strong>Tencel<\/strong>™<strong> <\/strong><\/p><p>Tencel™ is the name of an Austrian brand owned by  Lenzing AG and it's a trademarked name for the lyocell fibres. It is a cellulose fiber made by dissolving a sustainably sourced wood pulp and spinning it into yarns. It requires less energy and water for production than a conventional cotton and it maintains a closed loop process for the chemical treatment, where most of substances are recycled. Lenzig fibres are certified compostable and biodegradable in freshwater, marine and soil conditions by TÜV Austria, which means that they are biodegradable and compostable at the end of its useful cycle. It is soft, breathable and highly absorbent fabric with good resistance to wrinkles, making it a perfect choice for the travel capsule wardrobe.<\/p><p><strong>Lyocell<\/strong><\/p><p>Lyocell is a man-made, cellulose fibre created by dissolving wood pulp and spinning it into yarns. It requires less resources for production and it maintains a closed loop process for the chemical treatment. There is no difference between lyocell and Tencel®, the latter is simply a brand name, made by Lenzing AG in Austria. In fact, lyocell can be also known as Newcell and Excel - it is just made by other producers. Lyocell is biodegradable and compostable at the end of its useful cycle. It is strong, yet soft, breathable and highly absorbent fabric with good resistance to wrinkles, making it a perfect choice for the travel capsule wardrobe.<\/p><p><strong>Modal<\/strong><\/p><p>Modal is a man-made, bio-based fabric produced from beech tree cellulose. Since beech trees require less land and water to grow than cotton, modal is considered a more sustainable option than cotton. In comparison with other viscose fabrics, modal fibres are stronger, more durable, lighter and more breathable. Modal is also much more absorbent than cotton, slightly stretchy and silky-smooth in touch, which is why it will make a great addition to your luggage. <\/p><p><strong>Refibra<\/strong>™<\/p><p>Refibra™ is an innovative fabric contributing to the circular economy in textiles, certainly one of our favourite. It contains up to 1\/3 of the cotton scraps upcycled from the garment production, which are transformed into a cotton pulp and then combined with the sustainably sourced wood pulp to be transformed into a lyocell fibre. Refibra™ technology gives a second life to pre- and post- consumer sources, which would otherwise be sent to landfills or incinerated - by upcycling it into brand new cellulosic fibres. It has low cost and water requirements and it uses natural and renewable materials for production. It is breathable, lightweight, durable, anti-bacterial, water-absorbent, quick-drying, supporting the body's natural thermal regulation and remains odour-free for a much longer period than cotton, which makes it a perfect choice for the travel capsule wardrobe.  <br\/>Refibra™ has a good resistance to wrinkling and pilling, which translates into garment's longevity, unless exposed directly to UV and sunlight. Refibra™ is fully biodegradable and compostable at the end of its useful cycle, being fully composed from the natural fibres. <\/p><p><strong>Linen<\/strong><\/p><p>Linen is a durable natural fibre derived from the flax plant, being one of the longest-produced textiles reaching as far back as to the Neolithic Era. It is stronger, thicker and slightly heavier than the typical cotton fibre and even though linen might feel rough in touch at the beginning, it softens throughout time and use. It's lightweight, highly absorbent, breathable, antibacterial, and dries faster than cotton, which makes it a perfect choice for the summer travel capsule wardrobe. It is resistant to peeling and not too stretchy. Linen is naturally prone to colour fading and creasing, which is why some garment containing linen might gain a vintage-look over time. Being a natural fibre, linen is one of the least environmentally damaging fabric, unless the retting process involves harmful chemicals, hence it is best to opt for the organic linen. Linen naturally biodegrades at the end of its useful cycle. <\/p><p><strong>Elastane<\/strong><\/p><p>Elastane is a lightweight, synthetic fibre usually used in stretchable clothing, made from polyurethane. It is not an environmentally friendly fibre, however the lifespan of the fabric, which contains the elastane can increase even up to two times. This translates into longevity and durability of your garment. If elastane is added in small quantities to a mono-material (i.e. 3% elastane and 98% of organic cotton), it can still be chemically recycled at the end of its useful cycle - as the research and development continues, this will hopefully improve over time (example: first biodegradable versions are appearing on the market too). Additionally, elastane's stretching properties help your garment to keep shape for longer, preventing sugging or bagging. On the negative side of the elastane fibres, they are created from non-renewable resources (petroleum) and if added in an excess to a mixed fabric, extremely difficult to recycle. Additionally, the problem of releasing the microfibers or microplastics to the soil and oceans remains, which is why we encourage you to use the microplastic filters in your washing machine like <a href=\"https:\/\/planetcare.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/planetcare.org\/\">here <\/a>or microplastic bags like <a href=\"https:\/\/en.guppyfriend.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/en.guppyfriend.com\/\">here<\/a>. <\/p><p><strong>Organic cotton<\/strong><\/p><p>Cotton represents nearly half the fibre used in the textile industry and only part of it is what’s called organic cotton. If sustainably and ethically produced, organic cotton is a great alternative to conventional cotton and it’s likely the most popular choice for an eco-textile. Contrary to conventional cotton, it uses far less water, no insecticides, reduces contamination of groundwater, poses no risk of cancer to workers, and encourages biodiversity. Globally, conventional cotton cultivation accounts for about 5% of global pesticide use even though it is cultivated only on about 2.5% of global arable land. From a circularity perspective, being a natural fibre, it has the added benefits of being 100% biodegradable, given there were no harmful chemicals used during the processing of the fibre. Certain certifications can help with the evaluation. The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), covers the processing, manufacturing, packaging, labelling, trading and distribution of textiles, ensuring that both environmental and social standards, such as safe and hygienic working conditions, no workplace discrimination and fair pay rates, are respected. This isn’t however the only certification focusing on organic cotton. There are also others like Organic Content Standard (OCS), Cotton made in Africa Organic, the EU Organic Standard, bioRe Sustainable Cotton or the Fairtrade Cotton. <\/p><p><strong>Recycled polyester<\/strong><\/p><p>Recycled polyester is a better alternative to a virgin polyester. It is made of recycled plastic bottles or old clothes. Using recycled instead of virgin polyester reduces our dependency on fossil fuels, requires less energy, and produces fewer carbon emissions. By using plastic waste, it is diverted from oceans and landfills. The problem of releasing the microfibers and biodegradability remains the same though, which is why we encourage you to use the microplastic filters in your washing machine like <a href=\"https:\/\/planetcare.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/planetcare.org\/\">here <\/a>or microplastic bags like <a href=\"https:\/\/en.guppyfriend.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/en.guppyfriend.com\/\">here<\/a>. <\/p>"

Natural materials strengthen the circular system through biodegrading at the end of their useful cycle and since they easily decompose in the soil or water, they can safely return to nature where they came from. If the product is truly and 101% made from natural materials (including even threads and labels), it doesn't pollute soil nor oceans with the microplastic and while biodegrading it doesn't leech toxins into environment (unless such were used in the dying process). The drawback of using the natural fibres is that their colours fade faster and are more prone to discoloration, as well as they aren't as wrinkle resistant as the synthetic fibres. Luckily you can re-dye your clothes really easily and every Black-Friday we help you with that. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<!-- Horizontal Icons -->\n<div class=\"icons-c-w-c\">\n\n    <!-- Icon item -->\n    <div class=\"icons-item-c\">\n        <img class=\"icon-item-sz\"\n            src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0381\/8707\/3668\/files\/Black__25.png?v=1648046308\" \/>\n        <span> Recycled materials<\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <!-- End Icon item -->\n\n<\/div>\n<p>This product contains recycled fibres, which supports the circular economy model, where all raw materials are kept in use as long as possible.

Check our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reloopwear.com\/pages\/recycle\">'Let's Reloop'<\/a> tab for more information.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- Horizontal Icons -->\n<div class=\"icons-c-w-c\">\n\n    <!-- Icon item -->\n    <div class=\"icons-item-c\">\n        <img class=\"icon-item-sz\"\n            src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0381\/8707\/3668\/files\/Black__55.png?v=1648109573\" \/>\n        <span>End of Lifecycle - biodegradable\/recyclable<\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <!-- End Icon item -->\n\n<\/div>\n<p>This product is fully biodegradable and recyclable at the end of its useful cycle and can be recycled through a chemical\/mechanical cycle.

This model is beneficial for you, us and the environment. Here's why:<\/p><p>By introducing pre-orders, we want to eliminate the fashion overproduction problem and therefore waste (for both garment and materials). Knowing the demand ahead of time, allows us to adjust the supply and produce responsibly with the quantities calculated upfront, which is a sustainable alternative to a mass-production. Being a small circular brand, it also helps us to manage our investment better and reduce the risk of being left with unsold items.<\/p><p>What's in it for you? Not only you receive a discount in return for your patience, but most importantly it's a great practice of conscious shopping. Longer waiting time minimises the chances of compulsive buying and encourages thoughtful decision-making process. By choosing to pre-order, you support the sustainable sale models and contribute to a positive change in the fashion industry. Plus, you are the first one to get the new arrival and help us shape the way our products are designed :) <\/p><p>For more information on our pre-orders, visit our <a href=\"\/pages\/shipping\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Shipping and Returns - TO DO\">Shipping & Returns<\/a> page or feel free to <a href=\"\/pages\/contact-us-we-love-meeting-people-who-share-our-values\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Contact us!

For orders below we will add a shipping cost of 4,95 EUR in Germany or accordingly cost from our price list per each European country.

All orders are processed at our main hub in Füssen, Germany.<\/p><p><strong>30 Days Return Policy<\/strong><\/p><p>You have the right to cancel and return your order within 14 days, for any reason and without a justification. We want you to be happy with your purchase and make sure your products will be with you for a long time ahead, therefore we have an extended 30 days return policy.
