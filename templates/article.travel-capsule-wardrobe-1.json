        "content": "<p>You might have heard this term before; it was first introduced in the 1970s by English boutique owner Susie Faux and popularised in the 1980s by designer Donna Karan and her 7 Easy Pieces line. The concept is simple: versatile, high quality clothing that can be easily mixed and matched to create many different outfits. We like to think about a capsule wardrobe as a ‘tiny closet’ full of timeless, interchangeable pieces that you just love to wear. By buying intentionally and strategically, you can save money, space and time, while also saving the planet from unnecessary waste. Everyone wins!<\/p><p>.<\/p><p><a href=\"\/blogs\/travel-capsule-wardrobe\/the-ultimate-guide-to-creating-a-sustainable-travel-capsule-wardrobe-and-solve-your-packing-problems-forever\" title=\"The ultimate guide to creating a sustainable travel capsule wardrobe and solve your packing problems forever\"><strong>GO STRAIGHT TO THE TRAVEL CAPSULE WARDROBE FORMULA<\/strong><\/a><\/p><p>.<\/p><p><strong>SO MANY CLOTHES, SO LITTLE TIME<\/strong><\/p><p>Did you know we make around 35,000 decisions A DAY? Decision fatigue is an actual thing. And let’s be honest, if we go Marie Kondo on our closets, probably 80% of it won’t “spark joy”.  A capsule wardrobe forces us to have a more purposeful approach to our personal style and think about what we really like and what we actually use on our day-to-day. The result? A wardrobe full of versatile, interchangeable items that make you look like your best self. No more mornings wasted in front of the mirror trying to figure out what to wear, because any set you pick will look amazing!<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>TO EACH THEIR OWN: A CAPSULE WARDROBE FOR EVERY TASTE<\/strong><\/p><p>The most important of capsule wardrobe rules? There aren’t any. You can follow any capsule wardrobe formula and tailor it specifically to your preferences. Take a work capsule wardrobe, for example. Whether you work from home, at an office, or out and about, you can create something to suit your needs. Whatever your style is, casual or elegant, minimal or bold, by choosing timeless basics and complimentary colours and patterns, you can mix and match your way to a wide variety of great outfits.<\/p><p>Apart from being sustainable and saving time and money, there’s another considerable benefit of capsule wardrobes: they can fit in small suitcases! For those of us who love travelling but hate the stress of packing, a travel capsule wardrobe is the perfect way to kiss our packing headaches goodbye.<\/p>",

This might be the most challenging part for many people, but we’re going to help you make this process as smooth as possible with these little tips. <\/p><p><em>WINTER<\/em><\/p><p>If you’re going on a trip <strong>in winter<\/strong>, you would need to pack more sweaters than shirts. As we know winter clothes tend to take up more space in our luggage than summer clothes. A little tip here that would be handy is wearing your chunkiest sweater or jacket to the airport during your travel. If it’s too hot, then just hold it and keep it with you during the flight.  Once you’ve arrived at your destination, you can wear it.<\/p><p>RECOMMENDED <strong>WINTER <\/strong>TRAVEL CAPSULE WARDROBE:<\/p><p><strong>One-week- trip (6 pieces)<br\/><\/strong>1 sweater + 2 long sleeves\/shirts\/blouses\/t-shirts + 2 bottoms + 1 jacket\/coat<\/p><p><strong>Two-week (10pieces)<br\/><\/strong>2 sweaters + 3 long sleeves\/shirts\/blouses\/t-shirts +  3 bottoms + 1 knit dress + 1 jacket\/coat<\/p><p><strong>Three-week-trip (12 pieces)<br\/><\/strong>2 sweaters + 4 long sleeves\/shirts\/blouses\/t-shirts +  3 Bottoms + knit dresses + 1 jacket\/coat<\/p><p>If your destination is extremely cold, make sure to pack thermal clothing that you could wear under your layers. We recommend mulesing-free merino wool as a perfect travel companion.  <\/p><p><em>SUMMER<\/em><\/p><p><strong>In summer<\/strong>, the clothes are lighter and could fit more comfortably in your luggage. However in summer we tend to sweat more and therefore might need to wash our clothes more frequently than in winter.  A handy tip here would be to pay attention to the fabric of the clothes you’re packing, make sure it’s light and can dry quickly. Polyester, nylon, linen and merino wool are considered quick-dry fabrics. <\/p><p>RECOMMENDED <strong>SUMMER <\/strong>CAPSULE WARDROBE:<\/p><p><strong>One-week-Trip (6 pieces)<br\/><\/strong>2 tank tops + 1 T-shirt\/button down shirt + 2 bottoms + 1 dress +\/- (1 light jacket\/cardigan) <\/p><p><strong>Two-Week-Trip (10 pieces)<br\/><\/strong>3 Tank Tops + 2 Shirts\/button down shirt + 3 Bottoms + 2 Dresses +\/- (1 light jacket\/cardigan) <\/p><p><strong>Three-Week-Trip (12 pieces)<br\/><\/strong>4 Tank Tops + 3 Shirts + 3 Bottoms + 2 Dresses +\/- (1 light jacket\/cardigan) <\/p><p>Check out Reloop Hot Travel Capsule Wardrobe <a href=\"\/collections\/asia\" title=\"Asia\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">here.<\/span><\/a><\/p><p>.<\/p><p><strong>HOW TO CHOOSE THE SHOES YOU’RE PACKING<\/strong><\/p><p>To decide on choosing the best shoes for your travel capsule wardrobe,  you could also follow the same criteria we mentioned above; which is considering the weather and the type of activities you want to engage in during your trip. <\/p><p>For visiting a city during summer, sandals and sneakers would be the perfect choices. Are you planning on hiking? then swap the sneakers with your proper hiking shoes. If they’re too chunky, wear them during your flight so that they don’t take up much space in your luggage.  Do you plan on swimming and spending your trip next to the sea? Then pack some flip-flops along with the other shoes.<\/p><p>As for when travelling through winter make sure to pack some good boots that will keep you warm. You could also add some sneakers which could be the shoes you wear during your flight there. Also, don't forget some extra warm socks. <\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>WHAT ABOUT TOILETRIES?<\/strong><\/p><p>As you might already know, if you’re travelling with only carry-on luggage, there are some rules when it comes to packing toiletries. You’re limited to liquids that are less than 100ml and all liquids containers must fit in a (transparent) bag with a total capacity of 1 litre. This might sound very limiting but we have a couple of tips that would help.  <\/p><p>Try to minimise the toiletries you pack by only packing the essentials. This might be different from one person to another but here are the most popular: soap, toothpaste, toothbrush, shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, SPF cream, face\/body moisturiser cream,  body wash, hand sanitizer, a comb, a razor and some different make-up products. The list can go on of course, but what you do is start by eliminating anything that you can live without. <\/p><p>We recommend considering a swap from liquid cosmetics packed in plastic bottles to solid cosmetics for more zero-waste way of living. There are many options for solid shampoo, deodorant and toothpaste. Another thing you can try is checking the toiletries your accommodation is offering, as many of them offer soap, shampoo and conditioners. This way you can save more space in your toiletries bag.<\/p><p><\/p>",
