            "answer": "<p>Pre-ordering means ordering  upfront the products, that weren't yet produced and that you will receive only few weeks later. This model is beneficial for you, us and the environment. Here's why:<\/p><p>By introducing pre-orders, we want to eliminate the fashion overproduction problem and therefore waste (for both garment and materials). Knowing the demand ahead of time, allows us to adjust the supply and produce responsibly with the quantities calculated upfront, which is a sustainable alternative to a mass-production. Being a small circular brand, it also helps us to manage our investment better and reduce the risk of being left with unsold items.<\/p><p>What's in it for you? Not only you receive a discount in return for your patience, but most importantly it's a great practice of conscious shopping. Longer waiting time minimises the chances of compulsive buying and encourages thoughtful decision making process. By choosing to pre-order you support the sustainable sale models and contribute to a positive change in the fashion industry. Plus, you are the first one to get the new arrival and help us shape the way our products are designed :) <\/p>"
